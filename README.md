 ## Description
For week 19 we were tasked to build a text editor that runs in the browser. The app will be a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it will feature a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application will also function offline. We are given the starter code and 

 ## Installation
 Installing this application is simple. Just simply visit my Github and look for this repo. You have a choice of either cloning it or downloading as a zip and running on your personal station yourself. After installing please open the root directory of the repo, click open terminal, and run the command.
```
npm i
```
After you should run the command. 
```
npm run build
```
And finally to start the server simply run the command 
```
npm run start
```

 ## Usage
The main usage for the project was to build this text editor, given existing code to demonstrate my ability with the different resources given to us for this module. Such as Express, IndexedDB, Webpack & WebpackPwaManifest Plugins, Concurrently, Babel, and Babel extensions.

 ## Contributions
 For this project I used the student mini project for week 19 as the foundation of my code. I also used some of the functions provided by it as well.<br />
 I would also like to thank the module for the challenge as well, as I used the gif imaged to assit me when trying to reproduce the results.
